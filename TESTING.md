- add_recipe.html - lower accessibility score due to dynamic instructions and ingredients sections which do not have individual labels for the inputs, rather a group label

- cards reducing accessibility score due to being the same colour as the background, this was a design choice to keep the colour pallete simple and clean so as to not become distracting to the user.

- Performance score reduction due to the images being URL linked rather than appropriately sized and formatted uploads direct from the user.

- Best Practices score reduction due to two of the linked image URLS causing Cookie issues in Chrome Devtools.

- SEO reduction (Recipe Details) due to the floating more options Materialize button not being crawlable.
