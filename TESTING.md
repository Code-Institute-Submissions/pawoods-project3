# Testing

## Manual Testing

Manual testing was completed by myself as I developed the project, making sure I manually tested each component as it was added, I used Google Chrome Devtools to view the code from the browser alongside the rendered site.

Once I had the full functionality up and running, I asked friends family and my Code Institute cohort to use the site as much as possible to see whether there were any UX ommissions or components that didn't work as they would expect as a real life user. 

This proved insightful as other people managed to come across issues that I didn't face as the admin user of the site that I may have missed had I not planned to go back and test as a regular user once everything was completed. Getting the site live early meant I could fix these issues one by one earlier rather than finding them all later on in the develepment and possibly having to edit more as a chain reaction.

## User Stories

The below tables detail the paths I followed on the site to test each of the user stories, also documented with screenshots of the components and location on the site.

## Code Validators

### HTML

I used [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate all HTML files by URI, pasting each page into the address bar and checking to ensure no errors were found. After changing one section element to a div and removing the trailing / from an img tag, all sites received no errors.

### CSS

I used [W3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) to validate the style.css file and received no errors.

![CSS Validation Screenshot](/static/images/readme/testing/testcss.webp)

### JavaScript

I used [JsHint](https://jshint.com/) to check the script.js file for errors and after adding the ```/*jshint esversion: 6 */``` line to the top of the file to counter the ES6 errors, I only received undefined variable notes from the jquery materialize calls and unused variable notes from the functions which are all called directly from on clicks on the HTML files.

![JS Validation Screenshot](/static/images/readme/testing/testjs.webp)

### Python

I used the [Code Institue Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to check the app.py for errors, after fixing some whitespace errors and lines which were too long, I retested to find there were no errors.

## Lighthouse

I used Google Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse function to check the performance, accessibility and search engine optimization with scores documented below and notes to explain reduced scores in certain areas.

<details>
<summary>Home</summary>

-   Performance score reduction due to the images being URL linked rather than appropriately sized and formatted uploads direct from the user.

-   Form card reducing accessibility score due to being the same colour as the background, this was a design choice to keep the colour pallete simple and clean so as to not become distracting to the user.
